# Red Empire
Red Empire is a proof of concept beaconing Linux implant and command and control server. This project is largely inspired by OxRick's "Building a Basic C2" project, with the Red Empire's CLI implementation being that from OxRick's project. The remainder of the Red Empire project is all custom implementation.
